In this presentation, I am showing you some of the inner workings of PHP. We are going to look at how different language keywords and constructs are handled internally. Basically, everything is converted to goto, but the how and why, is not as simple as it seems! We'll also have a look at what sort of optimisations opcache does to make your code run faster.

This is a very in depth talk, mostly interesting to people that want to know how PHP works internally. Expect lots of wonkyness, a form of assembly, and trees.</description><watch_url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mT6hop_dKKI</watch_url><embeddable>0</embeddable><added_time>2019-12-17T01:30:35+00:00</added_time><added_by>marandall</added_by><rel_conference>php_barcelona_2019</rel_conference></video>
