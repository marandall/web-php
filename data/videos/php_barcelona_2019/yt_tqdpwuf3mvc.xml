This also happened to us and we suffered the most painful parts of microservices, without even having the benefits. After that, we started to develop focusing on decoupling and separation of contexts, but without putting ourselves any infrastructure barrier.

This talk will explain architecture problems suffered at Ulabox, taking into account factors like team size or enterprise objectives, and which is our proposal to evolve our architecture.</description><watch_url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqdpwuF3mVc</watch_url><embeddable>0</embeddable><added_time>2019-12-17T01:30:38+00:00</added_time><added_by>marandall</added_by><rel_conference>php_barcelona_2019</rel_conference></video>
