Maybe it&#x2019;s time to think of an alternative!

Let me convince you to ditch your PHP-FPM server and embrace the world of ReactPHP! Yes, you&#x2019;ve heard of ReactPHP, but that&#x2019;s &#x201C;too experimental&#x201D; for you. Guess, what: it&#x2019;s not, thanks to PHP-PM, a ReactPHP process manager, you can give your app a nice performance boost with an alternative production-ready application server.

Prepare yourself to dive into the lifecycle of a PHP request (compilation, opcode generation, memory allocation, execution, IO...) and to understand why there&#x2019;s not much more room for performance improvements using the current stacks. We will also discuss the pros and cons of the ReactPHP + PHP-PM approach using a Symfony 4 app as an example, including developer experience and deployment options with containers.</description><watch_url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZATfsy9wOG4</watch_url><embeddable>0</embeddable><added_time>2019-12-17T01:30:34+00:00</added_time><added_by>marandall</added_by><rel_conference>php_barcelona_2019</rel_conference></video>
