What is better than an API? A webhook of course! Webhooks are a key building block of a modern application, allowing systems to exchange data in response to events.

This session covers the basic theory of webhooks and shows some examples of how to handle them in your own applications. We'll also talk about when webhooks are a helpful design choice, and some pitfalls to look out for when you're working with them!

This session is recommended for anyone interested in teaching their applications to play nicely with others.</description><watch_url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14nQGlSSGkY</watch_url><embeddable>0</embeddable><added_time>2019-12-17T01:30:32+00:00</added_time><added_by>marandall</added_by><rel_conference>php_barcelona_2019</rel_conference></video>
