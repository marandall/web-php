     <p>Symfony is proud to organize the sixth edition of the SymfonyCon, the
     international Symfony conference. This year, to celebrate Symfony, we decided to
     bring the entire community to Portugal and discover the amazing city of Lisbon.
     If you like Symfony and share fun with professionals, this is where you want to
     be on December!</p>

     <p>We look forward to welcoming you to Lisbon, capital of Portugal and bordered
     by the Atlantic Ocean. Join us for talks, workshops, discussions and other
     serious work around Symfony and its environment, then sharing this very special
     Portuguese atmosphere... And of course, celebrate the community reunion!</p>
