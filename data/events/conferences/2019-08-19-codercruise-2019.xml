     <p>We are excited to announce the speaker lineup for <a href="https://www.codercruise.com/?utm_campaign=ccphp19">CoderCruise 2019</a>.
     Now for the 3rd year the team behind the original php[cruise] is bringing a conference to the open seas.
          <a href="https://www.codercruise.com/?utm_campaign=ccphp19">CoderCruise 2019</a> is a premiere conference experience,
          giving you an exclusive connection to your fellow community members. It will set sail from Port Canaveral on August 19th
          for a 5 day cruise that also visits Princess Cays and Nassau!</p>
          <p>Ticket sales are currently open and just like last year we've negotiated a low rate for our participants that is all inclusive,
           <a href="https://www.codercruise.com/register/?utm_campaign=ccphp19">starting as low as $435</a> per person
           (including 5-day cruise, food, drink <b>and the conference</b>!)</p>
