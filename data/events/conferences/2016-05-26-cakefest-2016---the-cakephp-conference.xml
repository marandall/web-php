            <p>Every summer we hold our annual conference dedicated to <a href="http://cakephp.org">CakePHP</a>. For the
                past 11 years, the framework has been a benchmark for PHP development,
                providing developers with a full stack MVC solution to build powerful
                applications which scale. This, coupled with an amazing community backing
                and thousands of plugins, makes <a href="http://cakephp.org">CakePHP</a> the number one choice for those
                who love code.</p>
