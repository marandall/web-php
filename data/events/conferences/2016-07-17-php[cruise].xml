     It’s been a long time coming … Back in 2004 php[architect] ran a conference-cruise, and ever
     since we’ve heard people asking for us to repeat the event.  We figured that 12 years was
     long enough of a wait.  Therefore we’d like to announce <a href="https://cruise.phparch.com">php[cruise] happening in 2016</a>!
     This 7 day long conference-cruise will be a unique event for the PHP community.
     Completely immersive and giving you, the attendee, a hands-on experience not to be matched!
     </p><p>
     You can learn more about the conference, the cruise, <a href="https://cruise.phparch.com/pricing/">how the pricing is structured</a>,
     and what talks we will be having by <a href="https://cruise.phparch.com">exploring our website</a>.  And please if you have
     any questions don’t hesitate to contact us.
     </p><p>
     Our Early Bird Sale runs just until December 31st, 2015 - <a href="https://cruise.phparch.com/registration/">So buy tickets soon</a> to
