     <p>WooHoo! SunshinePHP has hit it's 4th year and will happen from February 4th - 6th, 2016 in sunny Miami, Florida.</p>

     <p>As one of the largest community conferences in the U.S. our call for papers ended with 600+ submissions, so there is no doubt the schedule will be amazing this year. We will have a full tutorial day featuring 3-hour sessions followed by 2 days of 1-hour talks and inspirational keynotes.</p>

     <p>This year there is something special planned, we are introducing a 4th track featuring excellent speakers local to Florida who will join 3 more tracks of awesome international and domestic speakers. This means we will host 8 in-depth tutorial sessions, 40 educational talks, and 5 trend setting keynotes from some of the most inspirational and knowledgeable people.</p>

     <p>Then we add a hackathon, uncon, panel discussion on some hot topic, and fun social events to make SunshinePHP an unforgettable experience that keeps the PHP community buzzing all year long.</p>

     <p>Come in from the cold to enjoy some warm weather, and PHP, this February in sunny Miami.</p>
