"The big don't eat the little, the fast eat the slow" (Eberhard von Kuenheim, BMW)</p>

<p>With more and more business-critical applications, performance becomes decisive. HHVM and PHP 7 make PHP better than ever. The engine put aside, there are many different ways to improve the overall performances of PHP applications: database access, hardware infrastructure, software architecture, caching, and so on...</p>
