    <announcement lang="en">The PHP development team would like to announce the immediate availability of PHP 5.3.5.

This release resolves a critical issue, reported as PHP bug #53632, where conversions from string to double might cause the PHP interpreter to hang on systems using x87 FPU registers.

The problem is known to only affect x86 32-bit PHP processes, regardless of whether the system hosting PHP is 32-bit or 64-bit. You can test whether your system is affected by running [this script](/distributions/test_bug53632.txt)from the command line.

All users of PHP are strongly advised to update to these versions immediately.

**Security Enhancements and Fixes in PHP 5.3.5:**

- Fixed bug #53632 (PHP hangs on numeric value 2.2250738585072011e-308). (CVE-2010-4645)</announcement>
