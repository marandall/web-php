The PHP Development Team would like to announce the immediate release of [PHP 4.4.2](/downloads.php).

This is a bug fix release, which addresses some security problems too. The major points that this release corrects are:

- Prevent header injection by limiting each header to a single line.
- Possible XSS inside error reporting functionality.
- Missing safe_mode/open_basedir checks into cURL extension.
- Apache 2 regression with sub-request handling on non-Linux systems.
- key() and current() regression related to references.

This release also fixes about 30 other defects.
