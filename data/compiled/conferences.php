Helped by Clermont\'ech, a local developers organization, AFUP is happy to welcome you on May 23rd and 24th at the Polydome convention centre.

This year, part of the program will focus on performance. "The big don\'t eat the little, the fast eat the slow" (Eberhard von Kuenheim, BMW)

With more and more business-critical applications, performance becomes decisive. HHVM and PHP 7 make PHP better than ever. The engine put aside, there are many different ways to improve the overall performances of PHP applications: database access, hardware infrastructure, software architecture, caching, and so on...

This Conference aims to discuss best practices in PHP technology and related areas such as design, development techniques, database, open source, agile methodologies, design patterns, etc.

The event is held each year, preferably in a different city of the state, and it happens in partnership with a local educational institution or company. This year: [Unisul](http://unisul.br).

All of this is in line with the group\'s goal, which is to cross the state in order to get more people to participate, presenting PHP through the professionals who actually use the language, increasing the technical quality of the information discussed. The conference counts on renowned speakers from outside the state, who are considered a reference in Brazil, for this purpose; but it also includes local speakers.

However, the significant change is in us creating a curated educational experience for our attendees, with all brand new talks being made just for this event.

You see this year we organized php[tek] into a [series of tracks](https://tek.phparch.com/tracks/?utm_campaign=phpnet2019), each dedicated to teaching you in-depth information about a specific topic. Leading these tracks are hand-selected [track chairs](https://tek.phparch.com/speakers/?utm_campaign=phpnet2019), chosen for their knowledge in the field and excellent presenters. They are all working together to create a unique curriculum to take your skills to the next level.

Each track’s design is a [series of new talks](https://tek.phparch.com/schedule/?utm_campaign=phpnet2019) that flow together smoothly, and yet, you can drop in/out of a track throughout the day as needed. Each session is in a 1-hr timeslot. You can choose to sit in one room all day and learn a topic from beginning to end or bounce between the various tracks, putting together a unique learning experience tailored to your needs. The choice is yours.

We hope that you [choose to join us ](https://tek.phparch.com/registration/?utm_campaign=phpnet2019)for this unique experience. [Ticket sales are open](https://tek.phparch.com/registration/?utm_campaign=phpnet2019) with a few different price points, and the earlier you buy, the more you save.
