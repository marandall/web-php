     <p>What an incredible 2018 and 2019 for the PHP community! Part of the PHP Core Team that was working for Zend left. Some found excellent companies and they are rocking most than ever, like Nikita at JetBrains. PHP 7.4 is about to be released, and PHP 8 has been branched. Lavarel and Symfony have healthy growth. JIT is part of the imminent future, and I/O non-blocking frameworks are getting more often adopted in production.</p>
     <p>We\'ve crafted the best PHP conference possible just for you. To allow you to see the future and get ready before nobody else. You\'ll gather top-notch speakers and an awesome community eager to share a lot of knowledge. All of this will take place in the very center of the gorgeous city of Barcelona in an excellent venue.

     <p>The event is held each year, preferably in a different city of the state, and it happens in partnership with a local educational institution or company. This year: <a href="http://unisul.br">Unisul</a>.</p>

     <p>All of this is in line with the group\'s goal, which is to cross the state in order to get more people to participate, presenting PHP through the professionals who actually use the language, increasing the technical quality of the information discussed. The conference counts on renowned speakers from outside the state, who are considered a reference in Brazil, for this purpose; but it also includes local speakers.</p>

     We are glad to announce that we’ll be organizing the 12th edition of the Dutch PHP Conference, which will be held in Amsterdam from June 7th to 9th 2018. Thursday the 7th will be the tutorial day and June 8 and 9 will be the main conference days. DPC brings together the best speakers and PHP, Javascript and front-end talent from Europe and beyond for three days of high-level technical sessions.

     In-depth tutorial sessions
     The tutorial day on Thursday June 7th at the same venue gives an opportunity for a smaller number of attendees to spend some time with an expert, going in-depth on particular topics. These are small groups so that presenters can respond to individual questions, and as a result places are limited.

        We are glad to announce that we’ll be organizing the 11th edition of the Dutch PHP Conference, which will be
        held in Amsterdam from June 29th to July 1st 2017. Thursday 29th will be the tutorial day and June 30th and July
        1st will be the main conference days. DPC brings together the best speakers and PHP, Javascript and front-end
        talent from Europe and beyond for three days of high-level technical sessions. Our
        <a href="https://www.phpconference.nl/schedule" title="Schedule | Dutch PHP conference">schedule</a>
        is already online and features a variety of talks on PHP, DevOps, Security &amp; privacy, microservices, JavaScript,
        databases and much more; so come along to our two main conference days on June 30 and July 1 in Amsterdam.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>In-depth tutorial sessions</strong><br/>
        The tutorial day on Thursday June 29 at the same venue gives an opportunity for a smaller number of attendees to
        spend some time with an expert, going in-depth on particular topics - topics like Docker, domain modelling, Mob
        programming, ES6, Drupal8, Progressive Web Apps and more are all on offer. These are small groups so that
        presenters can respond to individual questions, and as a result places are limited.
      </p>

<p>AFUP, The French PHP usergroup, is glad to announce that the fourth edition of the PHP Tour will be held in Luxembourg City on May 12 &amp; 13, 2015. PHP experts will share their advanced knowledge and experience with developers, decision makers and companies, during keynotes, sessions and workshops.</p>

<p>This year, just around the corner of Amazon and Microsoft offices, the event will be partly focused on the theme "PHP &amp; the Cloud": tools, continuous integration, security, costs... But of course, a lot of talks will be about PHP itself, innovation and improvement. Julien Pauli, Thibaut Lenclos, Wim Godden, Oswald de Riemaecker and François Zaninotto are the first speakers confirmed for the event. Who will join this dream team? Stay tuned to discover the program in the next few days.
Presentation length is 45 minutes which includes question time. 3 hours workshops with limited audience are planned on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Still not convinced? This year, we celebrate PHP\'s 20th birthday, and AFUP\'s 15th birthday: book your ticket right now, and come to party with us! You’ve got your ticket ? Please book your hotel room as soon as possible : there are not so many hotels in Luxembourg-City, and May is a busy period in town.</p>
