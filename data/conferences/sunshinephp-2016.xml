  <content type="markdown">WooHoo! SunshinePHP has hit it's 4th year and will happen from February 4th - 6th, 2016 in sunny Miami, Florida.

As one of the largest community conferences in the U.S. our call for papers ended with 600+ submissions, so there is no doubt the schedule will be amazing this year. We will have a full tutorial day featuring 3-hour sessions followed by 2 days of 1-hour talks and inspirational keynotes.

This year there is something special planned, we are introducing a 4th track featuring excellent speakers local to Florida who will join 3 more tracks of awesome international and domestic speakers. This means we will host 8 in-depth tutorial sessions, 40 educational talks, and 5 trend setting keynotes from some of the most inspirational and knowledgeable people.

Then we add a hackathon, uncon, panel discussion on some hot topic, and fun social events to make SunshinePHP an unforgettable experience that keeps the PHP community buzzing all year long.

Come in from the cold to enjoy some warm weather, and PHP, this February in sunny Miami.
