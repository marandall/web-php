Thursday the 7th will be the tutorial day and June 8 and 9 will be the main conference days. DPC brings together the best speakers and PHP, Javascript and front-end talent from Europe and beyond for three days of high-level technical sessions. In-depth tutorial sessions The tutorial day on Thursday June 7th at the same venue gives an opportunity for a smaller number of attendees to spend some time with an expert, going in-depth on particular topics. These are small groups so that presenters can respond to individual questions, and as a result places are limited. More information about the Dutch PHP Conference at www.phpconference.nl</summary>
